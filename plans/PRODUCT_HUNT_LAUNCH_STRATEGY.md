### First Comment (Critical — sets the tone)
```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm [founder name], and this is ArchonX OS — the first operating system 
built to run 64 AI agents as a coordinated workforce.

Here's what makes it different:

🏁 **Chess Board Architecture** — 32 White (build) + 32 Black (stress-test) agents
👑 **Named Agents** — Synthia, Oracle, Blitz, Phantom... each with real specialties
🤖 **Daily Standup Meetings** — yes, our AI agents hold actual meetings
🔒 **9-Layer Security** — from leak detection to SSRF protection
📊 **Self-Improving** — agents train each other using reinforcement learning
💰 **Revenue Engine** — agents that find leads, price services, and close deals

We've been building this for months and today we're sharing it with the world.

Would love your feedback! Ask me anything about the architecture, 
the chess metaphor, or why we gave our agents personality files 😄

• Multi-language: English, Spanish, Swahili + 5 more regional dialects

🧠 ARCHITECTURE

• Bobby Fischer Protocol — structured decision-making for every task
• PAULIWHEEL methodology — Plan, Implement, Test, Evaluate, Patch, Repeat

## 5. SOCIAL MEDIA BLITZ (Vikki's Playbook)

### Twitter/X Launch Thread
```
🧵 We just launched ArchonX OS on @ProductHunt

An operating system where 64 AI agents run your business 
like a chess match.

Here's the full story 👇

1/ The problem: AI agents are powerful individually. 
But who coordinates them? Who makes sure Agent A isn't 
undoing Agent B's work?

2/ Our answer: a chess board. 32 White agents BUILD. 
32 Black agents BREAK. The tension creates quality.

3/ Every agent has a name, a role, and a personality file. 
Synthia is the White Queen. Mirror leads the Black Crew. 
They compete. The code gets better.

4/ They hold actual meetings. At "Pauli's Place." 
With agendas. And reports. And KPIs. 
We're not joking.

5/ Security isn't an afterthought — it's 9 layers deep:
• SafetyLayer (input/output sanitization)
• LeakDetector (22 secret patterns)
• CommandGuard (shell injection prevention)
• NetworkGuard (SSRF protection)
• SandboxPolicy (READ_ONLY → FULL_ACCESS tiers)

6/ The agents train each other using reinforcement learning.
20 use cases. From lead qualification to code generation quality.
They literally get better every day.

7/ And yes — one of our agents is named Viral Vikki. 
She speaks 8 languages, studies Google Trends hourly, 
and her job is to make everything we do go viral.
She wrote this thread. 💅

8/ Try it yourself:

We'd love your upvote and feedback! 
Every comment gets a reply. Let's go 🚀

### LinkedIn Post (Founder)
```
Today we launched ArchonX OS on Product Hunt.

It's the first operating system built to run 64 AI agents 
as a coordinated workforce — organized like a chess board.

Two years ago, I asked: what if AI agents didn't just work alone? 
What if they competed, collaborated, and improved each other?

Today that vision is real:
→ 32 White Crew agents build
→ 32 Black Crew agents stress-test
→ They hold meetings, file reports, and train each other
→ 9 layers of security
→ Reinforcement learning across 20 use cases
→ Revenue engine, voice agents, multi-language support

It's 100% open source.

If you've ever dreamed of having an AI team that runs 
while you sleep — this is the closest thing that exists today.

Would love your support and feedback. 🙏
