## Visual Identity

### Primary Colors

| Name          | Hex       | Usage                                                     |
|---------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Electric Green | `#00FF88` | Primary accent, highlights, code blocks, API callouts    |
| Dark Steel    | `#1A1A2E`  | Background, body text areas, terminal interfaces          |

### Visual Aesthetic

Franken-Claw's visual identity is built around the **Frankenstein metaphor**: something powerful assembled from the best available parts and brought to life with something new. Think: stitched seams visible in the icon, electric sparks at the joints, the confidence of a thing that knows exactly what it was built to do.

- **Icon:** A stitched-together claw — mechanical fingers with visible stitch marks at the joints, implying assembly from distinct components
- **Glow:** Electric green (`#00FF88`) emanating from stitch points and tool-call indicators
- **Motion:** Brief spark/jolt animation on tool execution events in UI
- **Background:** Dark steel (`#1A1A2E`) as the dominant field — this is a developer tool, not a consumer product

### Icon Description

The Franken-Claw icon is a robotic/mechanical claw rendered in dark steel with:

- Three to four articulated fingers, each with a visible stitch seam
- A central bolt or lightning-strike motif on the palm
- Electric green glow at the fingertips and stitches
- Bolt silhouette rising from the crown — the "brain" component
- Badge element on the wrist — the "badge" component
- A small scale/conscience indicator on the base — the "conscience" component

These three additions (brain, badge, conscience) are the visual representation of what Franken-Claw added to OpenClaw.

## Voice & Tone

### Personality

Franken-Claw speaks with:

- **Power** — this is serious infrastructure; the voice commands respect
- **Irreverence** — we forked OpenClaw and made it better; we're allowed to be a little proud about it
- **Technical rigor** — every claim is precise, every spec is exact, no hand-waving
- **Confidence** — Franken-Claw does not apologize for being what it is

### Tone Spectrum

| Context               | Tone                                              |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Developer docs        | Technically precise, direct, slightly irreverent  |
| API reference         | Formal, structured, unambiguous                   |
| Agent config files    | Terse, declarative, machine-friendly              |
| Changelog             | Factual, versioned, no fluff                      |
| Marketing/pitch       | Bold, punchy, confident                           |

### What Franken-Claw Does NOT Sound Like

- Apologetic or hedged ("it might be worth considering...")
- Vague ("a powerful new tool gateway")
- Generic enterprise ("leveraging synergies in our platform ecosystem")
- Cute or casual — irreverent is different from flippant

### Sample Voice

> "Franken-Claw runs at ws://localhost:18789. Every tool call goes through IronClaw. Every action is logged to PAULIWHEEL. If you are connecting a raw OpenClaw instance to an ArchonX agent, you are doing it wrong."

## Usage Guidelines

### Use Franken-Claw™ branding on:

- Developer documentation (this repo, `services/franken-claw/`)
- API reference materials for ArchonX agents
- Agent configuration templates that reference the tool gateway
- Security and compliance documentation referencing IronClaw

### Do not use Franken-Claw™ branding on:

- BENEVOLENCIA™ materials (separate entity, separate brand)
- End-user consumer materials (this is a developer/infrastructure brand)
- Any context that implies this is the upstream OpenClaw project
