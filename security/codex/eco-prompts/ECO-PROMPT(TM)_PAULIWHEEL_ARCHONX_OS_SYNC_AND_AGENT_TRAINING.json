  "primary_goal": "Make PAULIWHEEL the default coding behavior across the entire ecosystem by (1) installing it as a universal Toolbox Skill in ArchonX OS, (2) auto-attaching it to new coding agents (via ArchonX agent registry and enrollment flow), (3) running scheduled sync meetings + updates 3x/day via OS scheduler, (4) enforcing beads + Ralphy loop + Agent Lightning first across repos, and (5) running build/test to verify compliance.",
  "non_negotiables": [
    "PAULIWHEEL must be the default coding behavior for all coding agents.",
    "PAULIWHEEL must be a Toolbox Skill discoverable and callable by any agent.",
    "Any repo touched by any agent must install Agent Lightning first in that repo.",
    "All coding work must use beads and the Ralphy loop; no early stops.",
    "Three scheduled sync runs per day minimum.",
    "New agents must be auto-enrolled via ArchonX enrollment flow (event-driven if possible; otherwise polling).",
    "Every scheduled run must run build/test verification and produce a machine-readable report."
