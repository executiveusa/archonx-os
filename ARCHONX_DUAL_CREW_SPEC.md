# ARCHONX Dual Crew Specification

## Overview
The ARCHONX operating system implements a dual-crew agent architecture featuring 64 specialized agents working in coordinated teams.

## Core Agent Architecture

### Agent Types
The system includes two primary agent types that form the heart of the dual crew:

1. **Pauli Agent** - Analytics and logic processing
2. **Synthia Agent** - Synthesis and creative operations

### Agent Responsibilities

#### Pauli Agent
- Data analysis and pattern recognition
- Logic verification and validation
- System diagnostics and monitoring
- Mathematical computations

#### Synthia Agent
- Content synthesis and generation
- Creative problem solving
- Natural language processing
- User interaction and communication

## Integration Points

### OpenClaw Backend
All agents integrate with the OpenClaw backend for:
- Resource management
- Task coordination
- State persistence
- Inter-agent communication

### Visualization Layer
Agent activities are rendered through a video game-style UI that provides:
- Real-time agent status
- Task visualization
- Performance metrics
- Interactive controls

## Deployment
The dual crew system supports multiple deployment scenarios:
- Local development environments
- Cloud-based production systems
- Edge computing deployments
- Hybrid architectures

## Additional Agents
Beyond Pauli and Synthia, the system supports 62 additional specialized agents for domain-specific tasks.
