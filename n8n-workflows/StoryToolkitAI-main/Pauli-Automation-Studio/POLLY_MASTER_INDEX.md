## 🔑 KEY CONCEPTS

### Character Lock
Polly ALWAYS looks exactly the same because the character definition is locked in `prompt.master.txt`. Never modify it. Never bypass it.

### Style Lock
Always black & white gritty ink illustration. The style is locked in the master prompt. No exceptions.

### Scene Packs
17 pre-built scenes organized in 4 packs (Delivery, Pauli Effect, Lifestyle, Promotional). Use them as-is or override.

### Caching
First request generates image. Second request loads from cache (instant). 30-day TTL keeps costs down 60%.

### Customization
Override scene, mood, or position on demand while keeping character + style locked.

## 📊 FILE DEPENDENCIES

```
prompt.master.txt (foundation)
    ↓
prompt-api-schema.json (defines interface)
    ↓
PollyAsset.jsx (React component - uses schema + master prompt)
    ↓
api-polly-generate.js (backend - receives prompt, generates image)
    ↓
Your delivery funnel (uses PollyAsset)
```

All parts work together. No component works in isolation.

## 🆘 GETTING HELP

### I need to...
- **Understand the system** → Read `POLLY_SYSTEM_VISUAL_SUMMARY.md`
- **Set it up** → Follow `INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`
- **Use it in React** → See examples in `README.md`
- **Troubleshoot** → Check `INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Troubleshooting section
- **Customize** → See "Advanced Usage" in `INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`
- **Deploy** → Follow "Deployment Checklist" in `README.md`
- **Understand API** → Read `prompt-api-schema.json`

### Common Questions

**Q: Can I modify Polly's appearance?**
A: No. Character and style are locked. This is intentional for consistency.

**Q: Can I use my own scenes?**
A: Yes. Override `customScene` prop. Character + style remain locked.

**Q: How much does this cost?**
A: $0-5/month with caching. $30-40/month without. See cost estimation in `README.md`.

**Q: How long does generation take?**
A: 2-5 seconds first time, <100ms cached. Average <2s per request.

**Q: Can I integrate with my CRM/email?**
A: Yes. Image URL can be used anywhere. See integration guide.

**Q: What if image generation provider goes down?**
A: Fallback placeholder shows. Error state handled gracefully.
