# Pauli UGC Factory (LLM Instructions)

## What this repo is
This repository contains a self-hosted autonomous automation factory designed to generate "Pauli's Cartoon Truth" content and deploy niche-specific automations.

## Core Objective
Convert confusion about automation (n8n vs Python) into trust and leads for an autonomous AI agency.

## Technical Rules
- Prefer Python code/logs over UI-driven workflows for production reliability.
- All LLM outputs must be valid JSON when requested via the API.
- Never store secrets in code; use process.env.API_KEY.
- Character Voice: Urban Gen Z/Millennial, cynical of hype, direct, snappy.

## Interfaces
- dashboard: Control center for the daily pipeline.
- generator: Script factory for UGC ads.
- visuals: Cartoon scene generation (Gemini 3 Pro Image).
- production: Video animation (Veo 3.1).
