## Build Process: Preparing for Ralphy Gate

### Feature Branch Status
```
Branch: feature/P1-doc-normalization
Commits: 1
Files Changed: 30
Insertions: 813
Deletions: 0
```

### Ready for Build Checkpoint

The 30 files are now ready for Ralphy orchestration build/lint:

```bash
npm run build:parallel --phase 1
```

**Expected checks:**
- ✅ Markdown lint (no syntax errors)
- ✅ Schema validation (all required sections present)
- ✅ Link validation (all references resolve)
- ✅ Terminology consistency check (canonical terms used)

---

## Next Phase: BEAD-P1-003 (TEST)

After Ralphy build passes, TEST phase will:

1. **Schema Validation** - Verify all 30 files conform to spec
2. **Link Validation** - Verify 100% of cross-references resolve
3. **Terminology** - Verify all terminology is canonical
4. **Metadata** - Verify 30/30 files have complete headers
5. **Coverage** - Report on normalization completeness

**Expected Duration:** 2-3 hours
**Exit Criteria:** All tests pass, 100% compliance achieved
