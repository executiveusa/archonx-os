# PHASE 2 → PHASE 3 APPROVAL GATE
## Governance & Contract Hardening - Plan Complete

**Phase:** 2 of 5
**Status:** PLAN COMPLETE - Ready for Implementation Approval
**Date:** 2026-02-24 17:50:00Z
**Approval Required:** YES

---

## Phase 2 Planning Results

### Workstream 2A: Devika-PI Governance
✅ **PLANNED** - 5 implementation tasks sequenced

**Plan Summary:**
- Policy enforcement framework
- Governance wrapper with PAULIWHEEL integration
- Context7 MCP library documentation layer
- Devika agent configuration
- Dashboard control integration

**Effort:** ~9.5 hours implementation + testing
**Files:** 8 new Python files + config
**Success Criteria:** 10/10 security gates must pass

### Workstream 2B: Workflow Contracts
✅ **PLANNED** - 42 workflow contracts cataloged and specified

**Plan Summary:**
- 42 workflows identified across 5 categories
- Contract schema designed (JSON structure)
- Policy gate requirements defined
- Evidence paths documented
- Telemetry specifications complete

**Effort:** ~18 hours implementation + review
**Files:** 42 JSON contract specs + reference docs
**Success Criteria:** 100% compliance validation required

### Combined Execution
✅ **PLANNED** - Parallel workstream coordination

**Effort:** 2-3 days total (parallel execution)
**Ralphy Integration:** Build gates mandatory after each task
**Testing:** 100% pass rate required for all gates
**Approval:** Human required at test completion, before Phase 3

## Phase 2 Plan: APPROVAL CHECKLIST

**For Approver Review:**

### WS2A (Devika-PI) - Does the approach look correct?
- [ ] Policy framework design makes sense
- [ ] Governance wrapper approach sound
- [ ] Context7 MCP integration appropriate
- [ ] Agent configuration strategy clear
- [ ] Dashboard integration feasible

### WS2B (Workflow Contracts) - Does the approach look correct?
- [ ] 42 workflows cataloged comprehensively
- [ ] Contract schema sufficient and clear
- [ ] Policy gate requirements enforceable
- [ ] Evidence paths well-defined
- [ ] No obvious gaps in specification

### Execution - Are you comfortable with timeline?
- [ ] 2-3 day estimate reasonable
- [ ] Parallel workstreams manageable
- [ ] Ralphy build gates appropriate
- [ ] Test requirements clear
- [ ] Phase 3 dependencies satisfied

## What Happens Next

### If You Approve Phase 2 PLAN:

1. **IMPLEMENT Phase activates** (BEAD-P2-002A & 2B)
   - Agents: Devika-PI Integration Agent + Workflow Contracts Agent
   - Timeline: Begin immediately
   - Duration: 2-3 days parallel work

2. **Parallel Workstreams:**
   - WS2A Tasks 1-5 execute concurrently with WS2B
   - Ralphy orchestration active for all builds
   - Daily progress reports in dashboard

3. **Build Checkpoints:**
   - After WS2A Task 4: Build new governance code
   - After WS2B Task 3: Validate all contracts
   - Full Ralphy validation: All repos pass lint+test

4. **Human Gate (After IMPLEMENT):**
   - Test phase complete
   - All tests pass (100% target)
   - Review: `ops/reports/BEAD-P2-002_IMPLEMENT_COMPLETE.md`
   - Decision: Approve for Phase 3 or adjust

### If You Request Changes:

Specify modifications needed, and I will:
1. Update BEAD-P2-001 PLAN
2. Re-sequence tasks as needed
3. Generate revised approval gate
4. Await re-approval

### If You Hold Phase 2:

Phase 2 awaits your signal to proceed. System remains at Phase 1 completion ready for Phase 2 launch when approved.

## Files for Your Review

**Essential Reading:**
1. `ops/reports/BEAD-P2-001_PLAN_SUMMARY.md` ← Start here
   - Full plan overview
   - Both workstream details
   - Timeline + risks

2. Pre-existing Specifications:
   - `plans/DEVIKA_PI_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md` (normalized Phase 1)
   - `plans/ARCHONX_DASHBOARD_CONTROL_WORKFLOWS.md` (normalized Phase 1)
   - `AGENTS.md` (governance baseline)

## System Status (2026-02-24 17:50)

```
Phase 0: Baseline Audit          ✅ COMPLETE
Phase 1: Doc Normalization       ✅ COMPLETE & MERGED
Phase 2: Governance & Contracts  🚀 PLAN COMPLETE
         ├─ WS2A Plan Ready      ✅
         └─ WS2B Plan Ready      ✅

Next awaiting human decision:
→ Approve Phase 2 PLAN → IMPLEMENT begins
→ Request changes → Revise plan
→ Hold → Defer Phase 2 start
```

---

**PHASE 2 PLAN: ✅ READY FOR APPROVAL**

**Your decision required:**

- **APPROVE** → IMPLEMENT phase begins today
- **REVIEW** → Clarify any aspect
- **MODIFY** → Request plan changes
- **HOLD** → Defer to later

**Recommend:** APPROVE to maintain momentum (Phase 1→2 transition smooth, 2-3 day completion target keeps full 5-phase system on track for end-of-week production deployment)
