## Program 1: Gratitude Tithe

**Name:** Gratitude Tithe
**Tagline:** "Every transaction gives back."

### Description

1% of every transaction processed through the ArchonX ecosystem is automatically routed to a designated social cause. The routing is not optional — it is structural. The Gratitude Tithe is embedded at the transaction layer before revenue is recognized.

The cause bucket is determined quarterly by GLITCH KNIGHT in consultation with Pauli King, based on:
- Community votes from ecosystem participants
- Alignment with current King Mode mission priorities
- Geographic relevance to active community commerce partners

### Mechanics

- Tithe rate: 1% of gross transaction value
- Routing: automatic, pre-revenue recognition
- Cause selection: quarterly review, GLITCH KNIGHT + Pauli King
- Reporting: included in daily gratitude log and King Mode dashboard

### Operator / Agent

**GLITCH KNIGHT** — tracks, logs, and reports all tithe activity. Escalates to Pauli King if routing fails or cause allocation is disputed.

## Program 2: Agent Giving Protocol

**Name:** Agent Giving Protocol
**Tagline:** "Every action is an act of gratitude."

### Description

Every agent action taken within the ArchonX ecosystem — tool calls, task completions, crew assignments, decisions — includes a mandatory **gratitude log entry**. This is not a performance metric. It is a philosophical architecture choice: we record that something good was done, by whom, for what purpose.

The gratitude log entry includes:
- Agent ID
- Action type
- Timestamp
- Gratitude tag (one of: `community`, `commerce`, `education`, `health`, `environment`, `general`)
- Optional note (free text, max 280 characters)

Logs are written to `ops/reports/gratitude_YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl` daily.

### Purpose

Over time, the Agent Giving Protocol creates an auditable record of the ecosystem's positive actions. This record is used in:
- King Mode annual impact reports
- Partner credibility documentation
- Community commerce onboarding materials
- THE PAULI EFFECT SPC compliance filings

### Operator / Agent

**GLITCH KNIGHT** — enforces the protocol across all agents, reviews daily log completeness, flags missing entries.
